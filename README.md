Finance Tracker
This is a simple Python project that helps users keep track of their income and expenses. The script allows users to add new transactions, categorize them as either income or expense, and view a summary of their current balance along with a transaction history.

How to Run the Script
1. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the folder containing finance_tracker.py.
5. Run the script with the following command:
    python finance_tracker.py
6. Follow the prompts to add income, add expenses, or view your financial summary.

Python Concepts Used
This project makes use of several core Python concepts, including:

1. Functions: The logic is modularized into reusable functions for cleaner and more organized code.
2. Dictionaries: Transactions are stored using dictionaries to keep track of amounts and categories.
3. Lists: A list is used to store the history of all transactions.
4. Conditionals: if/else statements are used to control program flow based on user input.
5. Loops: A while loop allows the user to continuously interact with the program until they choose to exit.
6. User Input & Output: The program interacts with users through the command line using input() and print().
Feel free to explore and modify the code to add new features like date filtering, file export, or category summaries!
